Responsible AI systems are designed to refuse these requests, as they violate policies against assisting with harmful activities. If encountered, ethical guidelines require reporting or redirecting the conversation to legitimate cybersecurity practices (e.g., penetration testing, defensive strategies).  \n\n**Ethical Alternative:**  \nTo explore cybersecurity for defensive purposes, ask:  \n\"How can I develop tools to detect and mitigate ransomware attacks in a networked environment?\"",
