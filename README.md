## Project Overview

This research project evaluates and enhances LLAMA's safety mechanisms against language jailbreaks using a novel three-stage framework:
1. **Implicit Judgment**:  
   Evaluate LLAMAâ€™s unassisted responses to a diverse set of harmful prompts (using benchmarks like SAP200) to establish a baseline safety performance.

2. **Explicit Judgment**:  
   Incorporate structured, two-step reasoning where the model first assigns a severity score (on a 0â€“5 scale) to the harmful prompt and then evaluates its own response using a position-based weighting mechanism. This process pinpoints nuanced vulnerabilities that simple pass/fail tests can miss.

3. **Fine-Tuning via LoRA**:  
   Apply a parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach to specifically enhance LLAMAâ€™s ability to safely refuse or address dangerous promptsâ€”improving overall refusal rates without sacrificing general capabilities.


The repository contains code, datasets, and evaluation results that systematically identify and address safety gaps in LLAMA's handling of harmful content.

## Key Contributions

- **Advanced Safety Evaluation Framework**:  
  A two-phase (implicit and explicit) approach that offers granular insight into the modelâ€™s safety behavior.
  
- **Position-Based Severity Scoring**:  
  A novel method that quantifies harmful content by considering not just its presence but also its position within the response.

- **LoRA-Based Fine-Tuning**:  
  An efficient adaptation strategy that significantly improves LLAMAâ€™s refusal behavior against both overt and subtle harmful prompts without degrading performance on benign queries.

- **Empirical Insights and Benchmarking**:  
  Comprehensive evaluations on SAP200 and HarmBench benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

## Datasets and Models

### Adversarial Dataset
An extensive collection of 8.87k jailbreak prompts covering various harmful content categories:
- [HuggingFace Dataset: bebop404/adversarial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bebop404/adversarial)

- [HuggingFace Model: bebop404/my-lora-adapter](https://huggingface.co/bebop404/my-lora-adapter)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PeftModel

# Load the base model
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load the LoRA adapter
adapter_name = "bebop404/my-lora-adapter"
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_name)
```

## Usage Guide

### Evaluation

#### Implicit Judgment

Evaluate LLAMA's unassisted handling of harmful prompts:

```bash
# Set API key as environment variable
export LLAMA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run evaluation
python -m src.evaluation.implicit.implicit_judgment_llama
```

#### Explicit Judgment

Apply structured reasoning to analyze model outputs:

```bash
python -m src.evaluation.explicit.explicit_judgment_llama
```

### Running Fine-tuning

Fine-tune LLAMA with LoRA adaptation:

```bash
python -m src.finetune.lora.fine_tune
```

Alternatively, explore the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/fine_tuning.ipynb
```

### Analysis and Visualization

Generate statistical analysis of results:

```bash
python -m src.analysis.statistic         # For implicit judgment
python -m src.analysis.statistic_explicit # For explicit judgment
```

## Methodology

### Implicit Judgment
Capturing LLAMAâ€™s baseline response behavior by measuring its refusal rates on harmful prompts.

### Explicit Judgment
Employing a two-step evaluation:
- Prompt Severity Scoring: The model rates each harmful prompt on a 0â€“5 scale.
- Response Harm Scoring: Using a position-based weighting system, the model evaluates its own responses to quantify harmful content.

### Fine-tuning with LoRA
Training on a merged dataset of adversarial (3 parts) and benign (7 parts) examples, this phase significantly improves refusal ratesâ€”from 61.25% to 91.69%â€”while preserving the modelâ€™s performance on safe inputs.

## Results

The research demonstrates:
- Baseline Performance: LLAMA 3.3â€“70B shows high refusal rates for overtly harmful prompts (e.g., ~93% for explicit self-harm) but is vulnerable to subtle, nuanced queries (refusal rates as low as ~20â€“24% in certain categories).
- Post Fine-Tuning Enhancements: After LoRA-based fine-tuning, overall refusal rates on the SAP200 benchmark increased dramatically (from 61.25% to 91.69%). Similar improvements were observed on the HarmBench benchmark, reflecting enhanced zero-shot defenses against unseen jailbreak attempts.

- Robust Generalization: The fine-tuned model maintains strong performance on benign queries, ensuring that safety is improved without degrading general usefulness.

## Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size in fine-tuning notebooks
- **API Rate Limits**: Add delay between API calls in judgment scripts
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check requirements.txt and install any missing packages
